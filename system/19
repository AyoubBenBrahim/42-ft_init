# Daemons are processes that are often started when the system is bootstrapped and 
# terminate only when the system is shutdown. 
# ----
# There are three basic types of processes in Linux: interactive, batch and daemon.
# -> Interactive processes are run interactively by a user at the command line.
# -> Batch processes are submitted from a queue of processes and are not associated with 
# the command line;
# -> Daemons are recognized by the system as any processes whose parent process has a PID of one,
# which always represents the process init.
# init is always the first process that  is started when a Linux computer is booted up
# and it remains on the system until the computer is turned off.
