~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# OpenSSH (and the SSH protocol generally) can use public key cryptography 
# to authenticate users to remote systems.
# As a user, you start by creating a public/private key pair.
# You give the public key to the server administrator,
# who adds it to the server in the  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.
