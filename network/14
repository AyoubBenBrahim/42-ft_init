/etc/hosts

on most operating system the default configuration is that any mappings contained in the Hosts file
overrides any information that would be retrieved from a DNS server. In fact, if there is a mapping
for a domain name in a hosts file, then your computer will not even bother querying the DNS servers 
that are authoritative for that domain, but instead read the IP address directly from the HOSTS file.
