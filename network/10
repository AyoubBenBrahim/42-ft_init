# 64 hops max

# a star in place of one of the round trip times.  this notation means that no response (error packet)
# was received in response to the probe. In this case, the cause is probably congestion, 
# but that is not the only possibility.
# traceroute relies on low-priority ICMP packets, 
# which many routers are smart enough to drop in preference to “real” tra c.
# A few stars shouldn’t send you into a panic.
# If you see stars in all the time  elds for a given gateway, 
# no “time exceeded” messages came back from that machine. Perhaps the gateway is simply down.
# Sometimes, a gateway or  rewall is con gured to silently discard packets with expired TTLs. 
# In this case, you can still see through the silent host to the gateways beyond.
